# MovieRecommendation
file name Movie recommendation is a collabaration based approach

now according to me there is lot of issue in applying content based approach reason being content based principle depends on features of movie and there 1129 features for each movie make it a very tidious task but this is not a major issue

the thing is there are 1129 features for each movie  and there are 209171 movies therefore a matrix of (1129*209171) that is supposed to be present but when you look at the dataset of genome scores you will see that these 1129 features are stated only for movie ID---> 1-1025 not for all movie ID's

i mean its easy to built it for 5 features but for 1129 features it requires hell lot of computation power and one more tough its bit tough for me to figure out the syntax of using range function to use all the 1129 feature at a singkle time
  
i m open for disscussion on it
